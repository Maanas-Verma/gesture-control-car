# gesture-control-car
A car that can be control by the gesture of our hands with the help of adxl 335 sensor
FOR MAKING THIS GESTURE CONTROL CAR FOLLOW STEPS WRITTERN BELOW.

STEP1:-We first connect arduino pins 8,9,10 and 11 to motor driver pins in1,,in2,in3 and in4.

STEP2:-Then arduino pin A0 and A1 to x_axix and y_axix of adxl335.

STEP3:-Then 3.3 volt pin and ground pin of arduino to Vin and ground pin of adxl335 respectively.

STEP4:-After it made common connection of Vin and ground of arduino and motor driver and connect to battery with the help of a button.

STEP5:-Now connect out1, out2 to motor for right side and out3, out4 to motor for left side.

STEP6:-Now test your all connections.
